# Timebloc
This NodeJS app is supposed to create a custom interval work schedule and export it into a MacOS compatible file so that I can create and import a large number of events at once.

## Requirements and specifications:
- Version 1: Create a single calendar event
  - v1.0: Generic event called Birthday on 20th September 2001 from 1pm to 2pm
  - v1.1: Change event name
  - v1.2: Add feature specify date
  - v1.3: Add feature specify start time
  - v1.4: Add feature specify end time
- Test Version 1: console.log the calendar event and check output
